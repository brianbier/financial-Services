<p>Hello! My name is Brian Bier, through my career as a financial Coach I met some great people. The people I am referring to became my friends. We started as enemys trying to see who was best but finished together as a team. Each one of them has an individual story. Enjoy!</p>
<p>Like many entry level coaches. The first coaching session is one of the most frightening meetings ever. I think it's much more difficult than the hiring process at The Financial Clinic.</p>
<p>There is so much information that you need to research and understand for yourself. That I would say it can become overwhelming. One of my advice is to learn how to say "I dont Know". Every client that we meet has all kinds of interesting questions and they have a very high expectation of you so you must either know the answer or know how to say goodbye to your client because he will never come back.</p>
