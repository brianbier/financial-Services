<p>Hello! My name is Brian Bier, through my career as a financial Coach I met some great people. The people I am referring to became my friends. We started as enemys trying to see who was best but finished together as a team. Each one of them has an individual story. Enjoy!</p>
<p>Like many entry level coaches. The first coaching session is one of the most frightening meetings ever. I think it's much more difficult than the hiring process at The Financial Clinic.</p>
