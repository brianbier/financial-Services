<p>Viviana and Alyssa are two super stars...<small><br />They each started working as financial Coaches around the same time and together build a strong bond by helping each other manage challanging questions. Viviana is from Costa Rica and is a super cat lover. Ask her about her cat and you will see what I am refering too. You have been warned.<br />Alyssa is a caring person to work with and also a good friend to keep around. She is from Chicago and has plenty to say. As a financial Coach she has been learning and helping hundreds of people accomplish their financial Goals. She is very good with words and loves to drink wisky. Be careful she will get you drunk.</small>

<p>My Favorite Erica...<br /> <small> Well She is a handful but she is the best financial Coach there is. She helps thoundsands of people  around New York City and she stands up for the rights of herself and everyone else. She loves Mexico and will fight for that country even though she is a Citizen of the U.S. She loves out door activities, meeting people and drinking. She would become your bestfriend, sorry she is taken by someone name Davide. Never heard of him!</small> </p>

<p>The incredible Karen(far left)...<small><br />She is the Senior Financial Coach and and the leader and mentor of the coaches. She is widely known and appreciated by NYC low income communities. She is a super caring person and makes the best turkey sandwiches. She loves biking and drinking good wine. She use to work for a big for profit company as a financial planner and was tired of getting the rich richer. Ask Karen anything and she will know the answer.</small> </p>
